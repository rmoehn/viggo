A web application for assembling communication books.

There are people who can't communicate by speech, due to a stroke, for instance. 
For them one way of communicating is by using communication books. These are
similar to picture dictionaries, but usually individually assembled by a
therapeut. Assembling communication books often involves a copy machine,
scissors and glue. That's rather cumbersome and therefore some therapeuts told
me that they'd like a convenient computer program for making communication
books.

This repository is my attempt on such a program. However, I use it more as a
playground for getting used to web programming in Clojure and ClojureScript. So
don't expect straightforward development.
